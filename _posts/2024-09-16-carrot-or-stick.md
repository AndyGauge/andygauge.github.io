I've become aware through working with dogs that both a carrot and stick can be
effective in getting a pack to perform a certain way.  The carrot illustrating
how easy it is to train a dog when you have a treat.  The stick illustrates the
part we aim to become comfortable with.  As much as a puppy wants to use teeth
on our skin, or grab the leash and sprint towards traffic, a stick works along
with the treat.

Now don't think I just said beat a dog.  I'm talking about an illustration, that
when you have a dog you should understand that both are necessary to get the
behavior you want.  Treats in rewards, and when it is necessary firm, quick,
painless reproach that reinforces their reward for the opposite.  The longer
uncorrected, the harder the stick needs to be applied.

If you find yourself negative, reach for a carrot to spice it up.  Criticism
can have significantly more impact than positive feedback.  However, wounds
fester if not treated, and criticism needs to be available in suitable contexts.

manipulative insincerity and obnoxious aggression.  The key in giving feedback is
to care personally while challenging directly.

It isn't that different with dogs.  You know when they are hungry and they only
push the limits when you don't care that they need to run.  Work sometimes gets
in the way, but in the end we both think its worth it.
