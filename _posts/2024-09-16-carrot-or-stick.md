I've become aware through working with dogs that both a carrot and stick can be
effective in getting a pack to perform a certain way.  The carrot illustrating
how easy it is to train a dog when you have a treat.  The stick illustrates the
part we aim to become comfortable with.  As much as a puppy wants to use teeth
on our skin, or grab the leash and sprint towards traffic, a stick works along
with the treat.

Now don't think I just said beat a dog.  I'm talking about an illustration, that
when you have a dog you should understand that both are necessary to get the
behavior you want.  Treats in rewards, and when it is necessary firm, quick,
painless reproach that reinforces their reward for the opposite.  The longer
uncorrected, the harder the stick needs to be applied.

If you find yourself negative, reach for a carrot to spice it up.  Criticism
can have significantly more impact than positive feedback.  However, wounds
fester if not treated, and criticism needs to be available in suitable contexts.

manipulative insincerity and obnoxious aggression.  The key in giving feedback is to care personally while challenging directly.

It isn't that different with dogs.  You know when they are hungry and they only
push the limits when you don't care that they need to run.  Work sometimes gets
in the way, but in the end we both think its worth it.

## Modeling Behavior

Whether with a dog or with a team, it often is easier to model the desired
behavior rather than using words to command them.  When one dog shows another
the behavior, whether praised or treated will get the other dog to understand.

Demonstrating a desired behavior is reinforcement itself.  Your team will align
on the norm but it isn't up to any one member to edict the behavior, but
instead make visible the benefits of that behavior, and allow the team to pick
behaviors which benefit the team.

One false narrative of the modeling behavior method will deter you is when the
team norms drifting towards allowing one member to pick up the slack if they
model the behavior.  Two important things to remember when fighting this.
One, the goals of the team are aligned with your work, don't worry about anyone
else.  Two, even a dysfunctional team can be led to succeed just hold firm and
model the expected behaviors.

## Ending play

With dogs there's the advantage of having a privilege they enjoy and when you
see the behavior you want play can be a reward, and when play gets aggressive
you can end play to use a positive thing to reinforce against a negative.

With developers that's harder.  You can't quantify what they like or don't
and when we allow a team member to solve problems (if that's their play) taking
it away (assigning different work) comes only with privilege.  We don't get
the privilege to take away the work someone enjoys very often, and using
tactics to get people to do what we want is a hard road to maintain.
Especially if they become the wiser to it.

## Communication

I for one prefer being treated like a person, who is able to take direct
feedback and try to incorporate that in my continual improvement cycles.
If we aren't looking for ways to grow personally, direction on how to act
will lay on deaf ears.  The individual who isn't growing is shrinking and only
way to keep up with the inflation of expectations is improvement.

Fostering healthy communication over being lax or intense is the only healthy
solution.  Otherwise someone feels like a dog.
