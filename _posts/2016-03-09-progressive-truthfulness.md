I have begun the project 'Prayer Promoter' with a reddit style front-page for prayers.  Upvoted prayers filter down the list over time.  I've managed to get semantic UI installed using NodeJS 6.0.0-pre.  

    git clone nodejs/node
    cd node
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

I rememeber using Node v.0.4.3  Times sure have changed.
