Mark Rendell in his blog about the Phoenix Project listed in what they actually
did #8 Protected the bottleneck.  Brent was the single point of failure on the
IT team, both the go to person for everyones questions, and also the one who
struggled to make others like him.  How did the book solve that problem?

Mark's list continues with #9 Captured how to replicate the work done by the
bottleneck and #10 Identify the contraint and exploit it i.e have it work on
only the most important thing.  [See the whole list](https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/what-they-actually-did-in-the-phoenix-project-and-will-it-work-for-you/)

Once an individual demonstrates to others how to do the work, it is not up to
the bottleneck to replicate the work done.  Instead the bottlneck must focus on
only the most important thing.  How does a team identify their bottleneck,
replicate the work it does so that it may focus on only the most important thing?

# Modern Bottlenecks in Software Development Process

There tends to be individuals who, similar to The Phoenix Project's Brent, is
expected to perform duties rather than replicate them.  It is only when their
coworkers who used to come to him for everything experience the management
intervention protecting the most important thing that the bottleneck replicates.

Combatting this knowledge or domain sink hole is important to maintain healthy
teams.  Documentation is helpful, but only in the same way that specs can help
describe how code works.  It is a one-way communication meant for a wide audience.
A better way to set up success is with pairing.

Simple ways to improve this culture of sharing is to perform a code review over
zoom rather than only on github.  Interaction is pretty important to understanding
quickly.  Having the developer who doesn't understand a domain use the keyboard
to enter the code is the most effective way to replicate the work done.  A humble
navigator tends to be more effective at encouraging this most effective position.

# Exploit the constraint

In software development it is difficult to exploit the constraint, at least
not reliably.  More often than not, engineers use shared knowledge and synchronous
pairing to avoid having to be Jack-of-all-trades with zero specialty.  Unless
time zones, meetings, moods, and breaks line up there's very little left in the
day to exploit the constraint.

We've used a few tools to try and improve this concept.  Meetings are clustered
all before lunch so the people on other teams with the specialty knowledge have
long block of time later in the day.  Additionally, a day is designated as free
of meetings.  Finally, we've set up 6 hour blocks of time on two separate days
as a lounge where team members optionally drop in to work.

Usually the constraint is a moving target.  In order to exploit it, you need to
know what it is, get on the same page, then work only on what is the most
important.
