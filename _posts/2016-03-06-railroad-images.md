## Steam Powered Railroad Locomotive

Layout now includes a steam powered railroad engine.  The black and white image helps enforce the Ruby on Rails emphasis of web development.  Our site is intentionally high contrast, with the colors inverted.  This is how a developer's code editor and terminal emulators appear.


I've always been facinated by steam and other archaic technologies.  I find it amazing how fire and iron combine to make a powerful locomotive.  The Turk was a chess playing machine over 200 years old that beat such players as Benjamin Franklin.  We are not as advanced as we think we are.
