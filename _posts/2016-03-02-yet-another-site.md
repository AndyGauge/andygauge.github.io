## Yet Another Site

Yet Another Site launched today.  We are happy to be a part of this glorious little thing we call the internet.  This site is like other websites, full of links, pictures, and words.  We hope that some of them are friendly, pleasant, and inspiring.

We make websites for people.  Robots need not ask.  If you are a person with a business, church, or organization that wants people to know you or what you do, a website is the way to go.
