There is a mutually beneficial relationship between Tyler Technologies and the
state of Oregon.  Tyler Technologies understands government technology needs, especially
the procurement process, including competitive bid experience.

They are big enough to own property downtown Salem, OR to lobby for contracts.  They
do have one review on google [there](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oUh4b9NVyaUSMjND7)

> They wrote the software for Washington County Oregon's property tax submittal portal.  Terrible user interface for submitters.  Doesn't allow you to modify the names of line items previously entered incorrectly by the county.  Items previously noted as disposed of years ago still show up and previous additions fail to show.  Worse of all, there is no "Save your work" button, so if you get time out, you lose all your work.  The only way I've seen to save it is to advance to the next stage of the process, even if you aren't ready to advance yet.  Otherwise, all changes are lost. One one company milking tax payers with sweetheart government deals by providing poor performing products and services.

Tom isn't happy with the lack of competition for the contracts.  Truthfully, Tyler
Technologies has tons of tech debt, over commitments, and staffing problems.
Outsourcing hasn't proven successful and the Philippines is many time zones away.

Emerging technology should not be in the hands of a bureaucratic organization.
In order for the public good to benefit rather than the project plans of long term
commitments, the focus is proof of concepts that do not exceed the $10,000 maximum
for direct appointment.

The focus is public good, without expectations tied to renewals.  Fair local labor,
prevailing rate.  Secure AI assisted code to create new products to enhance whatever
platform they run on.

Not Profit Organization.
