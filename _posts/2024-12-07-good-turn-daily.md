Few lessons as important as do a good turn daily are taught to youth.  The lesson
remains relevant to adults.  Spend some time doing service for others.  During
my youngest's Eagle Scout court of honor, another scout solicited us to help with
Luckiamute. My boys helped plant 1500 plants to help with flood control.  I dug up
a few oak and pear trees to help with the project.

The state parks could have paid a contractor to do the work.  Instead, they trusted
Boy Scouts of America to do the work and save the tax payers a few dollars.  If I
wasn't at that court of honor, I wouldn't have been honored with the opportunity to
do my good turn today.

I consider it an honor to help OHA with their mental health statistics.  I love
free and open software.  Why is the daily part so much harder?
